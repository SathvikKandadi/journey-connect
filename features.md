I want to develop a car pooling app with the following features listed below :- 

-> Login / Sign up 
-> Option to choose: Give a Ride / Take a Ride 
-> If Giving a Ride then user has to choose his routes i.e select them on google maps 
-> If the user giving a ride is female then she has an option to give ride to only female riders if the only female riders is enabled 
-> If a person is giving a ride his name , phone no , gender , source , destination , vehicly type (can consider has no of seats ) , fare details . 
-> As soon as user logs in if the person is giving / taking a ride directly redirect him to that page . 
-> A ride is ended when the driver i.e the person giving the ride has ended the ride . 
-> For the person selecting take a ride option he can see all the details of drivers giving rides 
-> He / She has an option to filter by gender 
-> Note if only female option is available then only female riders have the option to book the ride . 
-> If a rider is booking a ride then he has to select his pickup along the route of the driver . 
-> The driver can see the rider pickup point 
-> riders details are also visible to the driver who have booked the rider.
